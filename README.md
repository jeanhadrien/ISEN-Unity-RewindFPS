Just a simple fps with a rewind function.

### Scripts 

- **ItsRewindTime** : When the user right clicks, it rewinds associated objects positions and rotations for up to 15 seconds.
- **myController** : Moves character in space.
- **myFPSCam** : First person camera controls with mouse.
- **myGun** : Uses Raycasts and particle effects to simulate shooting, applies forces to hit objects.

### Setup

Click "Fix Now" in the NormalMap settings window that will popup.

Open Scenes > Scene, play around with the shooting and the rewind function (right-click).

You can customize bullet force, fire-rate, character speed, mouse sensitivity, recoil.

Notice how the green character isn't affected by our shooting. This is because we use raycasts and layers.

### Improvements

- Fix rewind levitation bug
- Have a custom rewind speed
- Being able to jump lol
